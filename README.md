[Live Site](discussion-app.netlify.com)

Simple discussion app that utilizes local storage to save comments from anonymous users. Features error handling, the ability to remove comments, and the ability to report comments as spam. Utilizes a React front end. Utilizes scss for styles structuring.

Reporting a comment as spam triggers conditional rendering that changes the comment text color to gray.

Every 30 seconds a randomized comment is triggered by a setInterval call.
